# CREART

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CREART is to provide helper functions to explore circRNA expression data from RNA-seq experiments

## Installation

You can install the released version of CREART from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("egaffo/CREART")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to combine into one single expression matrix the output of multiple circRNA detection tools:

```{r example}
library(CREART)
## TODO: basic example code
```
